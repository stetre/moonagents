== Agent information

The functions described below provide information about SDL agents and help
agents in locating each other.

All functions raise an error on failure.

[[pid_of]]
* _pid_ = *pid_of*(_name_, [_rpid=0_]) +
[small]#Returns the pid corresponding to the given <<agent_name, _name_>>,
relative to the agent identified by _rpid_. +
To get the pid of an agent from its full name, pass _rpid=0_ (which is the default). +
To get the pid of a sibling agent from its local name, pass _rpid=$$parent_$$_.#

[[name_of]]
* _name_ = *name_of*(_pid_, [_rpid=0_]) +
[small]#Returns the <<agent_name, _name_>>, relative to _rpid_, of the agent identified by _pid_.
(by default _rpid=0_ so the full name is returned).#

[[parent_of]]
* _ppid_ = *parent_of* (_pid_) +
[small]#Returns the pid of the <<agent_hierarchy, parent>> of the agent identified by _pid_.#

[[state_of]]
* _state_ = *state_of*(_pid_) +
[small]#Returns the current state (a string) of the agent identified by _pid_.#

[[children_of]]
* {_pid_} = *children_of*(_pid_) +
[small]#Returns the list of pids of the <<agent_hierarchy, children>> created by the agent identified by _pid_ (note that this includes <<procedures, procedures>>).#

[[timers_of]]
* {_tid_} = *timers_of*(_pid_) +
[small]#Returns the list of identifiers (tid) of the <<timers, timers>> owned by the agent identified by _pid_.#

[[tree_of]]
* _string_ = *tree_of*(_pid_) +
[small]#Returns a string containing a description of the <<agent_hierarchy, sub-tree of agents>>
rooted at the agent identified by _pid_.#
