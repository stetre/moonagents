== Preface

This is the reference manual
footnote:[This manual is written in
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc], rendered with
http://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] and a CSS from the
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory[AsciiDoctor Stylesheet Factory].]
of *MoonAgents*, which is a 
http://www.lua.org[*Lua*] module for *event-driven concurrent programming*, whose design follows the
concurrency model of the
*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_and_Description_Language[ITU-T Specification and
Description Language (SDL)]*.
footnote:[The *SDL specifications* are freely available on the http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Z/en[ITU site].
Introductive papers to SDL, a bit outdated but still very good, can be found
in the http://www.telenor.com/innovation/telektronikk/archive[Telektronikk journal], 
_Volume 4.2000 "Languages for Telecommunication Applications"_, Ed: Rolv Br√¶k.)]

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with both SDL
and the Lua programming language.

For convenience of reference, this document contains external (deep) links to the 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html[Lua Reference Manual].

=== Getting and installing

For installation intructions, refer to the README file in the 
https://github.com/stetre/moonagents[*MoonAgents official repository*]
on GitHub.

=== Module organization

The MoonAgents module is loaded using Lua's 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-require[require]() and
returns a table containing the functions it provides 
(as usual with Lua modules). This manual assumes that such
table is named *moonagents*, i.e. that it is loaded with:

[source,lua,indent=1]
----
moonagents = require("moonagents")
----

but nothing forbids the use of a different name.

=== Examples

Complete examples can be found in the *examples/* directory of the release package.

=== License

MoonAgents is released under the *MIT/X11 license* (same as
http://www.lua.org/license.html[Lua], and with the same only requirement to give proper
credits to the original author). 
The copyright notice is in the LICENSE file in the base directory
of the https://github.com/stetre/moonagents[official repository] on GitHub.
