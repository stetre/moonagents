### SDL symbols palette for yEd

This directory contains a custom palette of SDL symbols to draw diagrams
with the [yEd Graph Editor](http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/)
(the symbols are made using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)).

To import the custom palette in yEd: `Edit -> Manage Palette -> Import Section` and open the
`sdl-symbols.graphml` file contained in this directory.
